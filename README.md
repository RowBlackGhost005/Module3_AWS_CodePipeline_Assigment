# CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Code Pipeline.

In this assigment I created a CI/CD Pipeline using AWS Code Pipeline.

# Requirements
An AWS Account

# Setup
For setting up this enviroment we are going to setup a repository in GitHub and a attach it to an AWS CodePipeline so it can grab the code from our repository and then deploying it to a S3 bucket (For this time due to this being a simple static HTML)
